As a kid I was fascinated by the Borobudur, which led me to buddhism early in my life. I recall wanting to join a sangha in the Netherlands in my late teens, but I never dared to take the step at the time.

It wasn't until much later that a good friend of mine put me in touch with Nalandabodhi. I joined the Dutch sangha in 2013, took my vows with Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, later also with Chokyi Nyima Rinponche and I have been practising ever since. With the usual ups and downs, of course.

These pages contain my personal musings: texts that inspire me, reflections on the buddhadharma and what have you. I wrote this with the intention to inspire others to explore the buddhayana. I hope it may be of some benefit to you.
