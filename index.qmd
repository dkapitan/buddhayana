Ever since I was a child, I have been drawn to buddhism. I was born in Jakarta, Indonesia, and was fascinated by the Borobudur ever since I was a kid. I recall wanting to join a sangha in the Netherlands in my late teens, but I never dared to take that step.

It wasn't until much later that a good friend of mine put me in touch with Nalandabodhi. I joined the Dutch sangha in 2013, took my vows with Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, later also with Chokyi Nyima Rinponche and I have been practising ever since. With the usual ups and downs, of course.

These pages contain my personal musings: texts that inspire me, reflections on the buddhadharma and what have you. I wrote this with the intention to inspire others to explore the buddhayana. I hope it is of benefit to you.
